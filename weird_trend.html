    <p style="font-size: 25px; margin: 50px; padding: 50px;">
        These trends are some of the weirdest, and questionable things people have done 
        on the internet during 2021. Most of these weird trends have a high reputation across tiktok, 
        and consist of many people trying it out, and some have even died during these weird trends. These are some 
        trends you should not try home, because you could end up injured.

    <h2>1.          Swallowing protein powder without Water!  (dryscooping)  </h2>    
    <p style="font-size: 17px; padding: 10px; margin: 50px;">
        The trend followed along on tiktok was extremely popular by young adults and teenagres.
         Many people have tried doing it, some of the reason is because they think it’s fun, or just want
          to earn more fame from tiktok. The challenge consists of swallowing a whole spoon of white powdery
           protein powder. It's even more dangerous than the cinnamon challenge, because the powder can clog 
           up your throat and could make it hard for you to breathe. Many doctors highly recommend NOT doing
            this challenge, and rather add water to the protein powder to make it safe to swallow.

    <h2>2.          The cereal challenge
    </h2>    
    <p style="font-size: 17px; padding: 10px; margin: 50px;">
        
        This challenge is something you shouldn't be doing when you're eating breakfast.
         It can cause suffocation in your throat, and can make it hard for you to breathe. 
         The challenge is weird because a person has to lie down and open his/ her mouth.  Then  
         somebody else takes some cereal and starts pouring it inside the lying person's mouth. Soon
          after the person pours milk inside his mouth, and the person who poured everything has to 
          eat the cereal from his/ hers  mouth! It's that moment when things can go wrong, because it 
          makes it hard for you to swallow saliva, and breath. This can cause the milk to go up your nose, 
          and you have no other choice rather than spitting everything out.

    <h2>3.  The fox eyebrow trend</h2>    
    <p style="font-size: 17px; padding: 10px; margin: 50px;">
       
        This is a weird makeup trend, because people think it’s cool to shave your half eyebrow and then 
        cover it up with makeup. This gives your eyebrow a more pointed look, or as the tiktok world says it
         “a foxy look”.

    <p style="font-size: 17px; padding: 10px; margin: 50px;">
        
        
      
        The penny challenge is a danger for you, and the firefighters. The challenge is 
        to take an adapter halfway into an electrical socket, and touch it with a penny or other 
        metal object. This trend was popular for teens, and they did it just to see some sparkle 
        from the adapter. This has caused some fires, and electrical shortages.

    <h2>5.    The big lip challenge
    </h2>    
    <p style="font-size: 17px; padding: 10px; margin: 50px;">
        

        People who wanted bigger lips have tried doing this, but many regret doing this. 
        The former youtube trend has gained a lot of attention in 2021, by people who love fashion, 
        trends and for those who want to look nice. The trend is to make your lips bigger by relatively 
        big suction power. People have tried using their vacuum cleaner and attaching it to their lips to
         make it bigger. For some reason young people like big lips, and they think it looks nice. Many 
         experts recommend Not doing this, because it can be harmful for your lips.

    <h2>6.  The pimple cupcake </h2>    
    <p style="font-size: 17px; padding: 10px; margin: 50px;">
       
        This is a weird trend, and you probably have an idea of what it is by reading the headline. 
        Yes it’s not real pimples, but it looks realistic. The cupcake looks disgusting and even got
         white goo inside of the cupcake just to give it the feeling of popping a real pimple. I’m sure 
         that I Wouldn't eat one of those nasty cupcakes.

    <p style="font-size: 17px; padding: 10px; margin: 50px;">
        
        The fun experiment you probably did in elementary school as a science project, is now a trend.
         Different channels on youtube show people take large amounts of fizzy drinks, and mentos “mints”
          to have big explosions.

    <h2>8.    Biting fake apple trend</h2>    
    <p style="font-size: 17px; padding: 10px; margin: 50px;">
        
        Apparently biting an apple is a trend now. But this trend is actually kinda cool, because 
        there is a brand called Martinelli apple juice, and they sell apple juice. The apple juice itself 
        isn’t as important, but the bottle is. So the plastic bottle has a round outer layer, 
        and looks similar to an apple, but when you buthe the plastic it sounds almost exactly like a real apple!

    <h2>9.  Breaking windshield from high volume speakers</h2>    
    <p style="font-size: 17px; padding: 10px; margin: 50px;">
        
The trend most popular among young teens is breaking their windshield from high volume
 of music played on big stereo speakers. The speakers generate so much loud sound that 
 the airways are more dense and are strong enough to break a windshield. If you are planning 
 on having high volume speakers then remember to have airdots to not cause damage to your ears,
  and don't get too close to the speakers.

    <h2>10. Filing your teeth</h2>    
    <p style="font-size: 17px; padding: 10px; margin: 50px;">
        
This is probably one of the weirdest and dumbest trends on tiktok. People who wanted perfect 
sized teeth have tried this. Some have faked their videos and said it works, and others have 
really tried this and regret their decision immediately. This trend is dangerous because it can damage 
your teeth. You don't really need perfect sized teeths (depends on person to person), all you really need
 is a big smile and brushing them.
